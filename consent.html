        <!-- Damn, you are hot as fuck. -->
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>1.0.0 submissive's Role</h2>

The submissive also agrees that, once entered into the submissive Contract, their body belongs to their master, to be used as seen fit, within the guidelines defined herein. The submissive agrees to please the master to the best of their ability, in that they now exist solely for the pleasure of said master.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>1.0.1 submissive's Veto</h2>
            <p>The submissive, where appropriate, holds veto power over any command given by the master , at which time they may rightfully refuse to obey that command. This power may only be invoked under the following circumstances, or where agreed by both master and submissive:
            <ul>
                <li>Where said command conflicts with any existing laws and may lead to fines, arrest, or prosecution of the submissive .</li>
                <li>Where said command may cause extreme damage to submissive's life, such as losing their job, causing family stress, etc.</li>
                <li>Where said command may cause permanent bodily harm (see 4.0.0) to the submissive .</li>
                <li>Where said command may cause psychological trauma to the submissive</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>2.0.0 Master's Role</h2>

The master also accepts the committment to treat the submissive properly, to train the submissive, punish the submissive, love the submissive, and use the submissive as they see fit.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>3.0.0 Punishment</h2>
            <p>The submissive agrees to accept any punishment the master decides to inflict, whether earned or not.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>3.0.1 Rules of Punishment</h2>
            <p>Punishment of the submissive is subject to certain rules designed to protect the submissive from intentional abuse or permanent bodily harm (see 4.0.0). Punishment must not incur permanent bodily harm, or the following forms of abuse:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood may not be drawn at any time. Punishment must stop immediately if blood is drawn.</li>
                <li>Burning the body</li>
                <li>Drastic loss of circulation</li>
                <li>Causing internal bleeding</li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness</li>

        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>4.0.0 Permanent Bodily Harm</h2>
            <p>Since the body of the submissive now belongs to the master , it is the master's responsibility to protect that body from permanent bodily harm. Should the submissive ever come to permanent bodily harm during the course of punishment or in any other submissivery related activity, whether by intention or accident, it will be grounds for immediate termination of this contract, should the submissive so desire. Permanent bodily harm shall be determined as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Death</li>
                <li>Any damage that involves loss of mobility or function, including broken bones.</li>
                <li>Any permanent marks on the skin, including scars, burns, or tattoos, unless accepted by the submissive .</li>
                <li>Any loss of hair, unless accepted by the submissive .</li>
                <li>Any piercing of the flesh which leaves a permanent hole, unless accepted by the submissive .</li>
                <li>Any diseases that could result in any of the above results, including sexually transmitted diseases.</li>

            <h2>5.0.0 Others</h2>
            <p><strong>tbh I don't agree with or need most of everything in here. Leaving it in at the moment just to read over it a bit more and think on it.</strong></p>
            <p>The submissive may not seek any other master or lover or relate to others in any sexual or submissive way without the master's permission. To do so will be considered a breach of contract, and will result in extreme punishment. The master may accept other submissives or lovers, but must consider the submissive's emotional response to such actions and act accordingly. Under no circumstance should the master allow such actions to unbalance the submissive emotionally, or allow such actions to result in ignoring the submissive .</p>
            <p>The master may give the submissive to other masters, provided the rules of this contract are upheld. In such a situation, the master will inform the new master of the provisions stated herein, and any breach by the new master will be considered a breach by the master as well, subject to all rules stated in this contract.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>6.0.0 Secrecy</h2>
            <p>All physical evidence of the submissivery will be kept in total secrecy, except where both master and submissive agree. Any violation of this clause shall be cause to terminate this contract, should the injured party wish it. The materials and physical evidence shall be kept under lock and key in a place acceptable to both parties.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>7.0.0 Alteration of Contract</h2>
            <p>This contract may not be altered, except when both master and submissive agree. If the contract is altered, the new contract shall be printed and signed, and then the old contract must be destroyed.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>8.0.0 Termination of Contract</h2>
            <p>This contract may be terminated at any time by the master , but never by the submissive, except under special conditions explained within this contract. Upon termination, all physical evidence of the submissivery, including this contract, will be destroyed, and all materials and belongings shall belong to the master , to be shared or kept as they see fit. The submissive , owning nothing and having agreed to give up all worldly possessions and body to the master , shall once again own their body, but nothing else, unless the master decides to give back their possessions.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="role-section">
            <h2>9.0.0 submissive's Consent</h2>
            <p>I have read and fully understand this contract in its entirety. I agree to give everything I own to my master, and further accept their claim of ownership over my physical body. I understand tha I will be commanded and trained and punished as a submissive, and I promise to be true and to fulfill the pleasures and desires of my master to the best of my abilities.
