        <h1>I'm so tired</h1>
        <p>I'm typing this here because every time I vent on pretty much any public forum, people jump on to a bandwagon of "shame, Drew! You should be better than that" and you know what? I'm fucking not better than this. I'm tired of supporting Rachel Conner or Rachel Dickey or whatever the fuck her name is. And I'm tired of being told that I should keep it to myself. Is it really my fault? I chose to enter a relationship with an absolute piece of selfish trash who wants to take and take and take and take like it's fucking Christmas all year round and everyone else can suffer as long as she gets what she wants? That's my fault and my responsiblity to bear?</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm working 40 hours a week (and studying another 30-40) and paying just under half of every paycheck to alimony and child support while Rachel doesn't work at all and we split time with our kids 50/50. This <i>should</i> mean that the level of paid child support is able to be renegotiated, but it's still at the same levels as it was when I was remote from Memphis and she was parenting about 80% of the time. Her argument for 4 years of alimony was that she needed that much time to "establish her career" but she took two years of doing jack shit towards that other than talking to a career coach and then she spent a few months and ten (or tens) of thousands of dollars on a bootcamp during a tech downturn to (what she bragged to my kids about) "set herself up to make 6 figures." This would be great and I'm all about it, but she's failed to produce. Every time things have gotten difficult for Rachel, she bails. I've had to cover for her multiple times when she failed out of something or just walked away and made it my responsibility to carry her through a lack of idk, giving a shit? Caring about her own responsibilities? At this point, I'm not even sure what it is.</p>
        <p>I'm just tired. I've worked 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 hours a week, sometimes 2 jobs for the past 15 years because Rachel wants more than what she has but it somehow became my fault that she didn't have it. When we first negotiated our divorce, I offered to take the kids full-time for the 4 years of alimony so that she could be a full-time student for 4 years and get a bachelor's degree if that's what she wanted (with a provision to renegotiate time with kids after the 4 years, naturally). I was laughed out of the room for even suggesting this after she said I "owed her a career like she gave me" which indicated that her level of childcare through my career steps equated to being given a bachelor's degree. This is just absolute bullshit.</p>
        <p>I hate Rachel Conner and more than I hate her, I hate myself for ever asking her out to a second date. I haven't even gone into the loss of friendships or the insance celibacy that she mandated during our marriage. What a fucking nightmare. I just can't wait for it to be over in September 2024 where she finally has to be responsible for herself and her own household and I get to be rid of her. Slightly less than I abhor her existence, I despise the family members who stood by and watched all of my efforts towards building a future for my kids be smashed to pieces by the selfish asshole named Rachel (she denies that she did this but if anyone is curious I have all of the bank statements, divorce docs, parenting plans, and receipts to show what a fucking monster this piece of shit really is).</p>
        <p>The only reason I don't kill myself and just be done with it all is because that wouldn't be great for my kids.</p>
