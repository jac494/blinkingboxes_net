        <h1>Why I Like Linux</h1>
        <a href="index.html">back to home</a>
        <h2>aka why I <i>don't</i> like Windows.</h2>
        <p>First of all: it's a very selfish and non-technical reason.</p>
        <p>It's mostly dumb because I couldn't figure out how to work with Windows: when I first became interested in computers and the idea of being able to write code and <strong>do more</strong> with them, Windows presented me with nothing but constant roadblocks. I wasn't allowed to do much by default and learning how to do anything on the computer beyond the graphical desktop seemed to be very taboo and against some set of rules.</p>
        <p>When I first found out about Linux, however, it almost felt somehow inviting from the first install. Interaction via the command line wasn't against the rules, it was the de-facto standard. Finding information was easy, getting help was easy. Learning about the operating system and running code on top of it almost seemed like a default. Since then I've learned that this is why the system exists in the first place, not like Windows where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fayyh0rhd5cwb1.jpg"><i>using the OS</i> is secondary to sales</a> that support the existence of Outlook/Exchange, Powerpoint, Excel, Word, and a browser.</i></p>
        <p>That's it. When I wanted to learn how computers worked, Linux invited me in and offered tons of documentation where Windows wagged a finger and seemed to say 'thou shalt not ask such stupid questions of how or why.'</p>
